# MVP
MVP implementing web solutions for data management.
We have been understanding for some time different approaches to data management. 
We believe Solid and other user data initiatives are perfect conceptual matches for Vectoria. We are now working on understanding how to apply our incentives mechanism design to best solutions in order to choose the best one.
Our first step here is implementing Vectoria.org and our service as Client/Server architecture so that we can better understand what parts of the service would be better decentralized and what better centralized.
